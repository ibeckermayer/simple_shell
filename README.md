# Simple Shell Project
## This is a custom shell implementation 
### First, compile the shell after cloning the repo by typing
`gcc *.c -o hsh`
### Then execute the shell by typing: 
`./hsh`

### You can:
* `type commands without full paths`: e.g., **ls** v.s. **/bin/ls**
* `Pass command arguements`: e.g., ls vs /bin/ls
* `Use cntrl-C properly`: e.g., it won't exit the shell
* `Use cntrl-D properly`: e.g., it will exit the shell
* `Pass command arguements`: e.g., ls vs /bin/ls
* `env`: show environment variables
* `cd`: into directores
* `use ; and &&`: to run mulitple commands
* `history`: view your command history
* `set and unset`: set and unset environment variables

### We have also created a checker which you can use to checkout our shell or other's [here](https://github.com/aharshbe/shell_testing_dir).
